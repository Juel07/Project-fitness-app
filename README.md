# General information
A fitness app built using React Native. It has 3 main screens present in the bottom tab navigator. The first screen contains a list of workouts (only one is shown for demo purposes), an Analytics screen to display the user's analytics data (with placeholder text) and lastly a Settings screen (with placeholder text).
Each workout, when clicked leads to a screen that displays a list of all the exercises and a progress cirlce. Similarly, when an exercise is clicked, it leads to a screen that displays information about it (sets/reps/rest time).
